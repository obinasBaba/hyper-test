## Project Structure

- `src/` - source code
- `src/components/` - components
- `src/components/app/` - next.js app directory
- `src/config/` - configuration files like constants.ts w/c hold all the API endpoints
- `src/hooks/` - custom hooks
- `src/styles/` - global styles
- `src/types/` - typescript types

## How to run

- `yarn install` - install dependencies
- `yarn dev` - run the app in development mode
- `yarn build` - build the app

## What I have used

 Next.js:  which enables me to use **server-components** for Banner-section, Product-List-section, and Category-section. I have used  server-components for these sections because these sections are static and do not change frequently. This makes the app faster and more SEO friendly.

 SCSS : for styling the page sections, and I have used typescript for type safety.
 Framer-motion :  for page transitions.


## What I will do
There are a few things that I will do if I will be chosen: 
- add a search bar, filter, and sort functionality to the product list section.
- add a product detail page.
- Use react-Error-Boundary to catch errors in the app.
